This is a simple skeleton video answering application based on a FS Wiki "answer.js" example. 

In this edit, Flite is jacked in as a placeholder for recorded announcments and WAV files are replaced with FSV, 
a native format to store audio (L16) and video (codec native) frames as seen inside RTP packets [2]. By restricting 
the channel to allow a single video codec only (ie: H263-1998) videomail compatibility between video clients is 
possible with an implicit audio-only fallback if otherwise. Note how Flite is not be perfect for the purpose 
(we use a callie-version) but its ok for this basic example to keep it flexible. The email attachment functionality 
is non-functional as FSV/RTP is not supported by any mediaplayer and no conversion utilities surfaced yet.

To Install:

- Place all scripts under /usr/local/freeswitch/scripts/javascript/
- Create writeable directory /var/spool/freeswitch
- Create a dialplan entry using the included example
- Extend it
